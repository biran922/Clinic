# Clinic
Clinic Project Created as a part of "Operating Systems" course.

This program shows the use of semaphore, threads, multithreading, linked lists in UNIX based environment and C.

There is a clinic with 3 dentists, each of them can only serve one patient.

In a Room of 10 patients, there is a sofa that can sit only 4 patients, so thus we have a queue of patients who wait to be sitted, sitting on the couch depends on the arrival time of the patient, so does the serve time of the dentits to a certain patients.

a dentits can serve only 1 patient at a time, also only 1 patient can pay for the service at a time after he got his treatment and is about lt leave.
